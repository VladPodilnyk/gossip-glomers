### Broadcast
In this part the task is to implement a broadcast system that gossip messages
between nodes. The task is split into three parts that progressively increase in difficulty.
Find the prompt for the problem [here](https://fly.io/dist-sys/3a/)

#### Part A
This part is quite simple. We need to implement a few RPC handlers on our server.
Since we begin with 1 node only, concurrency and topology do not matter.

#### Part B
#### Part C
